A. Problem Description 

   Data: x1, x2, ..., xn
   
1. Number of clusters is unknown
2. Variances and means of the data points in each cluster


B. How I solved it 
1. Expectation Maximisation algorithm to estimate the variances and means of each cluster
2. Consider the case of 2 clusters, 3 clusters and 4clusters and used the BIC selection creterio 
   for choosing the best numeber of clusters




















2 Cluster analysis 
intial mean     x1  x2  
intial variance v1  v2

Compute likelihoods
Class A: P(x_i|a)=Gausian(x1, v2) 
Class B: P(x_i|b) = Gausian(x2, v2) 

Compute posterior
a_i = P(a|x_i) = P(x_i|a)*prior /normaliser
b_i = P(b|x_i) = P(x_i|b)*prior /normaliser

Update mean 
mean_a = sum (a_ix_i)/(sum(a_i))
mean_b = sum (b_ix_i)/(sum(b_i))

Update variance
variance_a = sum(a_i(x_i - mean_a)^2)/ sum(a_i)
variance_b = sum(b_i(x_i - mean_b)^2)/ sum(b_i)

LIKE = sum (weight_A*likelihoods_A + weight_B*likelihoods_B)
